## About
Here is the [demo](http://www.codingisloving.com/WEBAPPS/datafarmer/index.html) of the app.This is based on my own understanding of the UI design. The app is built using AngularJS, Bootstrap and Grunt. 

The app uses 2 directives (app/directives) named baCheckboxtree (for the checkboxes) and baTree (for organizations folders & navigation menu). This directive is built based on [angular-bootstrap-nav-tree](https://github.com/nickperkinslondon/angular-bootstrap-nav-tree)

The app don't have backend implementation but instead HTML5 local storage to simulate the save and refresh features.
