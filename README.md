[Demo](http://www.codingisloving.com/WEBAPPS/datafarmer/index.html)

To see the demo locally:

_ Download & unzip the repo package

_ Go to dtfApp folder, type in the cmd/terminal "node server.js"

_ Open your browser, go to localhost:3000 (you can change the port in server.js)

This is a nice challenge, I would work more on this when I have free time.
