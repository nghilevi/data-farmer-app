## About
[Demo](http://www.codingisloving.com/WEBAPPS/datafarmer/index.html)

The app is developed with the help of AngularJS, Bootstrap and Grunt. The UI is simple and clean, based on my own understanding of the original design. 

The 2 directives (dev/app/directives) named baCheckboxtree (for the checkboxes) and baTree (for organizations folders & navigation menu), which are developed based on [angular-bootstrap-nav-tree](https://github.com/nickperkinslondon/angular-bootstrap-nav-tree)

All the buttons in the app are functional. The app doesn't have backend implementation but instead uses HTML5 local storage to simulate the 'save' and 'refresh' features.
