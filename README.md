## About
Here is the [demo](http://www.codingisloving.com/WEBAPPS/datafarmer/index.html) of the app.The app is barebone and is developed based on my own understanding of the UI design, using AngularJS, Bootstrap and Grunt. 

Some of the main components are the 2 directives (app/directives) named baCheckboxtree (for the checkboxes) and baTree (for organizations folders & navigation menu), which are built based on [angular-bootstrap-nav-tree](https://github.com/nickperkinslondon/angular-bootstrap-nav-tree)

All the buttons in the app are clickable. The app doesn't have backend implementation but instead uses HTML5 local storage to simulate the 'save' and 'refresh' features.
